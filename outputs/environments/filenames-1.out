$ spack cd -e myproject
==> This command requires spack's shell integration.

  To initialize spack's shell commands:

      # for bash and zsh
      . /home/spack/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

      # for csh and tcsh
      setenv SPACK_ROOT /home/spack/spack
      source /home/spack/spack/share/spack/setup-env.csh

  This exposes a 'spack' shell function, which you can use like
      $ spack load package-foo

  Running the Spack executable directly (for example, invoking
  ./bin/spack) will bypass the shell function and print this
  placeholder message, even if you have sourced one of the above
  shell integration scripts.
